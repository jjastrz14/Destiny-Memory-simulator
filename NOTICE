# NOTICE

## Project Overview
This repository contains a modified version of the DESTINY (Design Space Exploration of 3D Stacked SRAM/DRAM/NVM Integrated Memory) simulator. The project combines and builds upon three significant academic works in computer architecture simulation.

## Project Heritage

### DESTINY
- Original Development: Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad
- Year: 2017-2019
- Purpose: Comprehensive tool for modeling 3D and Multi-Level Cell memory
- Components: Core memory modeling framework, 3D stacking support
- Original Repository: https://bitbucket.org/sparsh_mittal/destiny_v2/src/master/

### CACTI3DD
- Original Development: Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.
- Year: 2012
- Purpose: 3D DRAM architecture modeling
- Components: Used for 3D memory architecture modeling capabilities
- Heritage: Based on CACTI memory modeling framework

### NVSim
- Original Development: 
  - Microsystems Design Laboratory (MDL)
  - Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University
  - Exascale Computing Lab, Hewlett-Packard Company
- Year: 2012-2013
- Purpose: Area, timing and power modeling for volatile and non-volatile memories
- Original Authors:
  - Cong Xu (Penn State University)
  - Xiangyu Dong (Penn State University)
- Components: Non-volatile memory modeling capabilities

## Current Version
Modified and maintained by Jakub Jastrzebski
Year: 2024

### Major Modifications and Improvements
