# This is a sample PCRAM configuration with mats organized and routed in bus-manner
# instead of traditional H-tree. The sense amps are placed outside the mats.
# The structure is similar to the design in "A 0.1um 1.8V 256Mb phase-change random 
# access memory with 66MHz synchronous burst read operation", JSSC 2007
